* About DTOS
#+CAPTION: DTOS Scrot
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt DTOS scrot :title DTOS Scrot :align left

DTOS is the name that I have chosen for my post-installation script that will deploy my Xmonad config, my Emacs config, as well as associated programs that are needed to create a proper "desktop" experience.  DTOS should work on Arch Linux or any Arch-based distribution.  The programs that will be installed include Xmonad, Xmobar, Doom Emacs, Fish and other programs needed to recreate DT's XMonad desktop.

* Installing DTOS
** Installation instructions
To install DTOS, you need to clone this repository and run the dtos.sh script.
#+begin_example
git clone https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dtos
cd dtos/
./dtos.sh
#+end_example

** IMPORTANT: You must answer YES to all YES/NO questions
You will be asked several =yes/no= questions:
+ Pacman will ask you if you want to replace libxft with libxft-bgra.
+ Pacman may ask you about other conflicting packages as well.
+ Doom Emacs will ask about creating an envar file, and...
+ Doom will also ask about installing all-the-icons fonts.

You must answer =YES (y)= to these questions!  Answering =NO= will cause pacman to stop installing the packages in pkglist.txt, thus leaving you with a broken installation.

** Potential bugs
*** Permission errors.
If you get an error when trying to execute the dtos.sh, make sure that dtos.sh is executable and owned by your user.
*** Slow download times.
This script can take a long time to complete since it will install more than 300 packages.  Also, make sure that the Linux distro that you are installing this on uses ParallelDownloads in /etc/pacman.conf for faster download times!  For an example, to enable ParallelDownloads so it downloads up to five packages at a time:

#+begin_example
ParallelDownloads = 5
#+end_example
*** Package conflicts that cause the script to fail
+ shell-color-scripts (from dtos-core-repo) conflicts with shell-color-scripts from the AUR.
+ dtos-opendoas (from dtos-core-repo) conflicts with opendoas from the Arch repos.

The solution is, before running the script, edit the pkglist.txt file and remove the packages above.

*** Doom Emacs doesn't launch.
After the installation is completed, Doom Emacs may not launch correctly the very first time.  Killing the Emacs server (if running) and restarting it fixes this.

#+begin_example
killall emacs
/usr/bin/emacs --daemon &
#+end_example

* Contributing to DTOS
Community contributions to the DTOS script is welcomed.  There are a few things to consider before making a merge request.
** Edit README.org
I understand that non-Emacs users may be confused with the way literate programming works, but the actual DTOS script is README.org which gets converted to dtos.sh.  So the file you should edit is README.org and not dtos.sh.  Through the magic of Org Mode in Emacs, README.org gets converted to dtos.sh.  If you edit dtos.sh (and not README.org) and make a merge request, then I have to manually edit README.org to make it conform to your proposed changes.  For a big merge, this is a lot work and could lead to mistakes being made in copying/pasting your changes.
** Test your changes before pushing
It would be a good idea to keep a clean installation of an Arch-based distro in a virtual machine, and then clone that clean VM when you need to test the script.  Please don't do a merge request without attempting to run the script in a fresh VM (one that you haven't previously ran the script on).

* Features to add in the future:
+ Sddm is installed but we don't enable it, because most distros already have a login manager.  But I'd like to disable the currently enabled login manager and enable sddm.
+ To fix Doom Emacs not launching correctly on first attempt: killall emacs && /usr/bin/emacs --daemon &

# NAME: DTOS
# DESC: An installation and deployment script for DT's Xmonad desktop.
# WARNING: Run this script at your own risk.
# DEPENDENCIES: dialog
#+end_src
* Check that user is NOT root!
Don't run this script as root!  This is done for safety reasons.  This script makes a lot of changes to the $HOME of the $USER of this script.  For obvious reasons, we want $USER to not be 'root' and $HOME not to be '/root'.  Instead, run this script as a normal user.  You will be asked to enter a sudo password at several points during the installation.

#+begin_src bash
if [ "$(id -u)" = 0 ]; then
    echo "##################################################################"
    echo "This script MUST NOT be run as root user since it makes changes"
    echo "to the \$HOME directory of the \$USER executing this script."
    echo "The \$HOME directory of the root user is, of course, '/root'."
    echo "We don't want to mess around in there. So run this script as a"
    echo "normal user. You will be asked for a sudo password when necessary."

#+begin_src bash

    echo "#####################################"
    sudo pacman-key --recv-key $_pgpkey
    sudo pacman-key --lsign-key $_pgpkey
}

receive_key || error "Error receiving PGP key $_pgpkey"
#+end_src

* Install the packages from repositories
All packages listed are either in the standard Arch repos or in the DTOS repos. All of these will be installed using pacman. =NOTE:= The package 'doom-emacs' will be installed using pacman, but because it requires user interaction during the installation process, it is not included in the array below.

#+begin_src bash
# Let's install each package listed in the pkglist.txt file.
sudo pacman --needed -Sy - < pkglist.txt
#+end_src

* Copy configs over from /etc/dtos into $HOME
While it would be easier to make packages that could install DTOS configs directly to the appropriate places in the $HOME folder, pacman does not allow for this.  Pacman is not allowed to touch $HOME ever!  The better way to do this is to install the configs in /etc/skel which is the standard directory to place such config files, but on many distros (for ex. Manjaro and Arco) /etc/skel is already used to store the distro's own config files.  So to avoid conflicts, all DTOS configs are placed in /etc/dtos and then copied over to $HOME.  A backup of config is created.  BEWARE!

=NOTE:= The /etc/dtos directory contains files and directories that are automatically copied over to a new user's home directory when such user is created by the 'useradd' or the 'adduser' program, depending on your Linux distro.
#+begin_src bash
echo "################################################################"
echo "## Copying DTOS configuration files from /etc/dtos into \$HOME ##"
